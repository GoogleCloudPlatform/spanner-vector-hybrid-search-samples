You can think of these fragments as sentences, concepts, words, etc...

       "      <td>Since both correctness and availability are critical, Spanner uses principles of fault-tolerant design to mask failures of these components and achieve high reliability for the service. For example, checksums are used to detect data corruption at many levels. Spanner tablets, which store a fragment of the database, are replicated across three or (usually) more data centers and the reads and writes use Paxos to achieve consensus and consistency of the distributed state. Checksums are also used to detect corruption of a tablet replica. The data for these tablets is stored in files, and the file system keeps multiple copies of the data blocks within the data center, using checksums to detect corrupted blocks. Finally, we proceed cautiously when rolling out new software versions, alerting on any anomalies that may be caused by a new bug.\\n\\nUpping reliability with chaos testing\\nWe run over a thousand system tests per week to validate that Spanner‚Äôs design and implementation actually mask faults and provide a highly reliable service. Each test creates a production-like instance of Spanner comprising hundreds of processes running on the same computing platform and using the same dependent systems (e.g., file system, lock service) as production Spanner. Most tests run for between one and 24 hours and execute tens or hundreds of thousands of transactions.</td>\n",

Cloud faults\\nAccess to Spanner from the Google Cloud Platform is mediated by Spanner API Front End Servers, which proxy requests coming into Google Cloud through Google front ends to a Spanner database. External clients open sessions with the Spanner database and execute transactions on these sessions. For Spanner, we crash the Spanner API frontend servers, which forces sessions to migrate to other Spanner API frontend servers. This should not be visible to the client (besides some additional latency).\\n\\n6. Regional outages\\nThe largest faults we simulate in system tests are outages of an entire region, forcing Spanner to serve data from a quorum of other regions. The majority of our system tests simulate several kinds of regional outages, triggered either by file system or network outages, and we verify Spanner continues to serve. This resilience is a property of the Paxos algorithm, which guarantees progress as long as a quorum (2 of 3, or 3 of 5) of replicas remain healthy.\\n\\nSpanner earns its reputation for reliability\\nSpanner is fault tolerant by design.

       "      <td>Since both correctness and availability are critical, Spanner uses principles of fault-tolerant design to mask failures of these components and achieve high reliability for the service. For example, checksums are used to detect data corruption at many levels. Spanner tablets, which store a fragment of the database, are replicated across three or (usually) more data centers and the reads and writes use Paxos to achieve consensus and consistency of the distributed state. Checksums are also used to detect corruption of a tablet replica. The data for these tablets is stored in files, and the file system keeps multiple copies of the data blocks within the data center, using checksums to detect corrupted blocks. Finally, we proceed cautiously when rolling out new software versions, alerting on any anomalies that may be caused by a new bug.\\n\\nUpping reliability with chaos testing\\nWe run over a thousand system tests per week to validate that Spanner‚Äôs design and implementation actually mask faults and provide a highly reliable service. Each test creates a production-like instance of Spanner comprising hundreds of processes running on the same computing platform and using the same dependent systems (e.g., file system, lock service) as production Spanner. Most tests run for between one and 24 hours and execute tens or hundreds of thousands of transactions.</td>\n",
